ðŸ©º Pneumonia Detection from X-Ray Images ðŸ©º
Overview
This project uses a deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is deployed as a web application using Streamlit. Users can upload an X-ray image, and the model will classify it as either "Pneumonia detected" or "Normal Pneumonia Not Detected."

Features
Upload X-ray images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG formats.
Real-time pneumonia detection.
Prediction heatmap to visualize the affected areas.
Model accuracy: 96%

Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib
  
Installation
1- Clone the repository:
